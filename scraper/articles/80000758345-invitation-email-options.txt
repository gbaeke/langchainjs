After your users have been registered (and verified), they will receive an email with the login URL. The attendee will receive their personal login details depending on the 'scheduled invitation time' (see below). There are 2 options to send out the e-mail: Thola sends out the e-mail via MailjetCustomer sends out the e-mail via own mailing systemThola sends e-mailIf Thola sends out the invitation email, the users will receive an email from welcome@thola.events . This e-mail contains an .ics file which allows users to save the event into their calendar programs (for example: Outlook).In this .ics file the users can find their login url. You can either choose the default Thola template or you can customise this e-mail at an extra cost of 110€ / hour.Customer sends e-mailIf you rather want to send out all communications via your own organisation, that is possible too! Read here how you can generate your login URL.Important: If your users register via our Thola platfrom, you cannot send out the e-mail yourself. They will automatically receive an invitation e-mail from Thola. Scheduled invitation timeAs an event organiser you can define how many hours before the start of the active period of your event, your attendees should receive their personal login details.
