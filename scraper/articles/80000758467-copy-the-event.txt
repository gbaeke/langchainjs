If you want to use the configuration of your test event or any other passed event as a baseline for your next event, then you can make a copy.Follow the next steps:Go the dashboardOpen the event that you want to copyGo the general info & event settingsSelect 'copy event' in the left bottom cornerChoose a new slug for you next event (important: the slug cannot be changed afterwards!)Choose a new event nameSelect a start and end timeIf you like to copy all your rooms, roles, media and avatar configurations then slide the blue button to the leftAfter selecting 'copy' you will be automatically redirected to the dashboard of your new event!! Important:Â please keep in mind that when copying an event, users and announcements are NEVER copied. You will need to insert them again. However, meetings are copied, but not automatically. You will first have to open the room (in which you have added the meeting) in the visual editor and then save it. Once this is done, your meeting will appear under 'meetings' in the dashboard menu. In case you had added a custom URL to one of your meetings, you need to add it again, because it won't be copied.
