A booth is another option that you can use to include sponsors or partners in your event. Just like a billboard, a booth is a group element that consists out of buttons, embedded elements and images. The difference with a billboard is that you are free to choose how many buttons and elements you'd like to display. Also the location of these elements can be chosen freely. How to configure a boothGo to the dashboardSelect the event that you want to configureGo to 'rooms'Click on the 'visual editor icon' of the room in which you want to add a boothClick on 'add element' and select 'booth'Go to the properties on the left sideGive your booth a name (optional)Choose the location and size of your boothUse your computer mouseUse your keyboard commandsFill in the x and y-axis, width and heightSelect 'always behind' if you want this booth to always be placed behind other objects or avatars Upload your booth by selecting an image from the media library Select 'flip horizontally' if you want to mirror the image over the x-axisFill in the elements that you want to add to your boothButton: read here how to configure a buttonEmbedded element: read here how to configure an embedded elementImage = select an image from the media library and place it anywhere you likeLink image = select an image from the media library and place it anywhere you like + add the URL to where your image should navigate to.  Important: you can use 'back to booth' under 'properties' to return to your booth and to continue adding new elements to it. Press 'save'
