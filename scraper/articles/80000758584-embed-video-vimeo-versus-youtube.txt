If you'd like to integrate videos into our platform via an embedded element, then your video first needs to be published on a video hosting website like YouTube or Vimeo. YouTubeIn order for you to get the 'embed URL', you are obligated to publicly publish your video on YouTube. It's not possible to publish your video privately. VimeoOn Vimeo on the contrary, you can publish your video privately and will still be able to retrieve the embed URL. If you don't have a Vimeo account, then you are welcome to use Thola Vimeo account where we can host your video privately for free. Besides that, with Vimeo you can also choose on which domains your video can be embedded. For more security we can choose to only allow embedding into the Thola platform. Other video hosting websitesIf you are using a different video hosting website and don't know where to find to embed URL, you can contact support@thola.events or create a new support ticket.
