You can have multiple organisation owners and event managers configuring your event simultaneously. However, it is recommended that your rooms are being configured by one peron at the same time. If two people are editting the same room at the same time, then the person who has saved last will get a notification that his/her changes won't be saved and will be overwritten by the other person who saved the room first.
