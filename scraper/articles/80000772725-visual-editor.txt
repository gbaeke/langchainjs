In case you pressed ‘undo’ too many times, you can still redo the previous action to navigate through the history of actions. We added icons on top of the editor to use these actions or you can use the keyboard commands (see above)Aspect ratioThe aspect ratio is used to describe the width and height of an element. If the aspect ratio is activated and you make your image wider, then the height of your image will be adjusted proportionally. By deactivating the aspect ratio, you can change the width (or height) of an element while the height (or width) stays the same.
