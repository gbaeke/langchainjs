Just like the media library, the avatars also consists out of three levels: general, organisation and event.Important: General avatars are overwritten by avatars on organisation level which in turn are overwritten by avatars on event level. This means that if there are no avatars added under 'organisation' or 'event', that we will use the standard set of avatars under 'general'.GeneralUnder 'general' you can find our standard set of avatars that we use by default for your event. If you don't like the pixelated avatars, we also have 2 other sets of avatars available for you. You can find them in the media library under the tag 'avatars'. Only Thola team members (admin) can add new avatars under 'general'.OrganisationIf you want to use other avatars than the standard set under 'general', then you can upload them under 'organisation'. By adding them under 'organisation' they will automatically be used for all the events that you create within your organisation. Only Thola team members (admin) and organisation owners can add new avatars under 'organisation'.Important: if you do want to use our standard set of avatars under 'general' but you like to add some extra ones, don't forget to select 'copy from general'.EventIn case that you want to use specific avatars for only the event that you're configuring, then you should add them under 'event'. Both Thola team members (admin), organisation owners and event managers can add new avatars under 'event'.
