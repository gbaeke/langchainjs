StructureThe media library is devided into 3 levels:  GeneralHere you can find all the media files that we have made accessible for all our clients. You are free to use them for all your events. Only Thola team members (admin) can add new assets to 'general'.OrganisationHere you can find an overview of all media files that have been added by your organisation. These files are only accessible within your own organisation, but can be used for any of your events. For example, images such as your logo or your own company branded avatars can be interested to add on 'organisation level' because they most likely will be reused in each event. Only Thola team members (admin) and organisation owners can add new assets to 'organisation'.EventHere you can find an overview of all media files that have been added for one specific event, namely the one that you are configuring. These files are only accessible for that speficic event. For example, imagine that you are organising an event in space theme. All space-images can better be placed under 'event level' because you probably won't use them again for your other events. Both Thola team members (admin), organisation owners as event managers can add new assets to 'event'. DisplayThere are 2 view options to display your media files:Display imagesThe images are displayed in large size. Show listThe images are displayed in the list with: small icon, name of the image, size, category, tags and actions.
