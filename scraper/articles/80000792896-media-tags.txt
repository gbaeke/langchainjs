Besides the three levels, we use media tags to organise our media library. Media tags help you to group images. For example: we have created a tag 'room background', where you can immediately see all room backgrounds that are available for you to use.Follow the next steps to add new tags: Go to the dashboardSelect the event for which you want to add new mediaGo to the media librarySelect an image under 'organisation or event level'Hover over the imageSelect 'add tag'Choose your tag from the dropdown menu or create a new one by typing in the name of the tag and pressing 'add tag'Important: depending in your user rights, you can only add tags to images on organisation or event level. An organisation owner can add tags to both, whereas an event manager can only add tags to images on event level.
