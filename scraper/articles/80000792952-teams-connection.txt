Our platform is deeply integrated with Microsoft teams.Â In this section of the organisation page you can see which tenant is connected to launch meetings or (video)calls via Microsoft Teams. By default we use our Thola tenant, but if you rather want to use your own that is possible as well.If you prefer to use your own tenant then you need to inform us by sending an e-mail to support@thola.events or by creating a support ticket. Connecting your tenant to our platform will bring a additional cost since we will need to setup a meeting to explain what needs to be done.
