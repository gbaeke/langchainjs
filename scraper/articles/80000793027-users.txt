In the last section of your organisation settings you will find an overview of all the users that have ever been to one or more events of your organisation. In this list you will be able to search by name, email address and filter on ‘organisation owner’. Next to that you can also add a new organisation owner. When you provide the name and email address, this person will receive an invitation email to set the password/authentication options to start using our dashboard.If you click on a user, the user details will appear. Here you can find a list of which events that person attended and what roles were assigned to this person. In case you would like to change some of these roles, you can click on the name of the event and a new tab will open to edit the settings for that user in that specific event.
