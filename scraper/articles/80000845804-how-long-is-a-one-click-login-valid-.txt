The one click login is valid as long as the doors of your event are open. Changing the "Doors open" will never impact the validity of a one click login link. For example: in the example below the one click login won't be accessible anymore after 1th of august 2021 18:00.After the doors closed time has passed, the user will get the notification 'could not authorize your request' if he/she tries to open the one click login. Warning: changing the doors closed time will impact the validity period of your one click login. Here are a couple of scenarios that can happen with its consequences:1: Close date is in the future and your change it to a moment in the future => your users will be able to access the event until the new date.2: Close date is in the future and you change it to a moment in the past => your users will no longer be able to access the event with the existing one click login link. The one click login link becomes invalid and can never be used again.3: Close date is in the past and you change it to a moment in the future => your users will need a new one click login link because once a one click login link has been expired it will never be usable anymore. You can resend a new login link via the users module of your event.
