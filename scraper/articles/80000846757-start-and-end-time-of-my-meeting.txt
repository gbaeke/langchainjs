Depending on what element you are using to integrate a meeting, it can be interesting to fill in the start and end time of your meeting. Meeting in a big screenIf you are using a big screen component to integrate a meeting via a session, then you should ALWAYS leave the start and end time empty under 'meeting details' in your meeting. This is because you already set the timing of your meeting in the session itself. Filling in the start and end time in your meeting details for these sessions can result in strange behavior. For example, if you set the meeting start later than in the schedule of the big screen, then the attendees will get an error message saying that the meeting will start at a later time even though the meeting is 'live' in the big screen component. Also, if you have indicated under 'session' that your meeting will start at 8:00, but in your meeting details you have entered 7:00 as starting time, then the meeting will only become active from 8:00. You won't be able to join the meeting earlier from the platform. Important: if you have indicated under 'session' that your meeting will end at 9:00 but your meeting is running out, then you won't be kicked out of the meeting after 9:00. You can easily continue your meeting. If you have a next session planned, then this session will now be visible in the big screen. Meeting in a buttonIf you are integrating a meeting button and you want your meeting to only be active between a certain time, then you should indicate the start and end time under 'meeting details' under 'meetings' in the menu. If you leave these timings open and don't have a meeting owner, then your meeting will be active as soon you have configured the button.
