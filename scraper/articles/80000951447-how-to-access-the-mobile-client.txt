We've created a mobile client so that users who access your events on Thola via their mobile devices, will have a similar event experience as the desktop users. The mobile users will receive their login URL in the same way as the desktop users, namely by means of an email sent out by Thola or by yourself. The mobile user will open this email on his/her phone and will access the platform by clicking on the login URL that was included in the email. This means that nor the desktop user, nor the mobile user will have to download an application to access Thola. Important: always check the mobile version when setting up your events in Thola. Read here how you can change certain configurations specific for the mobile version.
