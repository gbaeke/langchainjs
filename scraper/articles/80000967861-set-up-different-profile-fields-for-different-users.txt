Depending on the type of event that you're organising you might have different kind of users. Therefore not all profile fields might apply to all your users. For example: an event with employees and students. For employees you want to add 'jobtitle' and 'company', whereas for the students you want to add 'study' and 'school' as profile fields. To make a distinction between employees and students, we will work with a 'hidden field', 'hide expression' and 'conditions'.How to configure different profile fieldsGo to the dashboardSelect the event that you want to configureGo the general information & event settingsGo the profile configuration & custom ccsAdd all the profile fields that you want to include for both kind of users(for example: jobtitle, organisation, study and school)Add a new profile field 'typeofuser' and select 'hidden'In order to prevent that students will see the profile fields 'organisation' and' 'jobtitle' or employees will see the profile fields 'study' and 'school' when clicking on their name in the menu bar you will need to insert a 'hide expression'.The format of a hide expression is the following: field.parent.model.X !== 'Y'X = the key of your hidden profile field (in this case: typeofuser)Y = the type of user for who this profile field may be visible For 'organisation' and 'job title', Y = employeeFor 'study' and 'school', Y = studentIn this case you will need to fill in 4 hide expression for: organisation, job title, study and school Instructions for using multiple values in the hide expression:Write ' && ' behind your first expression to add another oneFor example: field.parent.model.X !== 'Y' && field.parent.model.X !== 'Z'For example: field.parent.model.typeofuser !== 'student' && field.parent.model.typeofuser !== 'employee'How to configure different subtitle linesOnce you have added a hidden profile field, you can now continue with the subtitle lines in the attendee info cardFirst configure the desired subtitle linesSelect 'add condition'Select 'typeofuser' under 'profile field'Write 'employee' under 'value' of the corresponding subtitle lineWrite 'student' under 'value' of the corresponding subtitle lineExplanation: by setting up this condition we will only display this subtitle line IF type of user = employeeExplanation: by setting up this condition we will only display this subtitle line IF type of user = studentVERY IMPORTANT !! in order for this conditional formatting to work, you need to indicate what type of user each attendee is. You can do this via the bulk upload or you can add this manually via the user menu in the dashboard: Bulk uploadManually via the user menuResult:
