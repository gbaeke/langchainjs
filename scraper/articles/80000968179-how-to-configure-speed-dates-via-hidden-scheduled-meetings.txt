In order to stimulate networking on your event, you can consider including a speed-date session. 5 minutes before the speed-date the users will receive a reminder. They will also receive a notification if someone has joined the meeting. When clicking on 'join the meeting' (see picture below) a pop-up will appear to ask how the call may be launched (via the Teams application or via the web browser). Read here how you can set up speed-dates on Thola: Configure speed-dates via (hidden) scheduled meetingsMake sure that you have registered your users first. Read more about it here.Go to the dashboardOpen the event in which you want to include speed-datesGo to 'scheduled meetings' in the menu Select the button 'schedule meeting'Add attendees by selecting their names You can schedule meetings between 2 or more attendeesOptional: write a messageThis message will be displayed in the reminder the users will get to join the speed-dateFor example: speed-date 1Optional: hide meeting in scheduleIf you want to make sure that your participants don't know with who they will have a speed-date, you need to select this box. If you have selected this box, then they will only be able to see with who they had a meeting after the speed-date has started.Select the date and time of your speed-dateIndicate where this meeting will take place (remote or live @ event)Important: in case that you want to organise a lot of speed-dates and it's too much work to do this manually, you can reach out to support@thola.events so that we can create a template for you.
