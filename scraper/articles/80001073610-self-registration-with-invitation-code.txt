This is a code that users will have to enter while registering. This code needs to be communicated in advance for example by e-mailing your attendees. Once the user has registered, they will receive an email from welcome@thola.events to confirm their email address in order to receive their personal login URL. Follow the next steps to add an invitation code to your registration page:  Go to the dashboardSelect the event that you want to configureGo the general information & event settingsType your "secret key" under "invitation code"
