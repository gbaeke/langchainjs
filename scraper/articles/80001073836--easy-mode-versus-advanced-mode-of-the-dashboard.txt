Taking into account that we have different kind of users within our Thola dashboard, we have decided to let the user choose between an ‘easy’ and ‘advanced’ mode. The easy mode hides certain functionalities to keep it simpe and straightforward, whereas when the dashoard is in advanced mode, you can configure all details of all functionalities.How to switch mode in the dashboardLog into the dashboardSelect the event you want to configureIn the top right corner you can find 'editor mode'Switch to easy/advanced depending on your preferencesDifference between easy and advanced modeEasy modeThe easy mode is convenient when you want to make small changes to the configuration and you don't want to be overwhelmed by all functionalities in the dashboard. In practice this means that in the easy mode we hide certain fields to keep it simple. For example:Profile configuration in easy mode We restrict this to the bare minimum so that you can easily set up your profile fields.Properties of a button in easy modeAlso here we restrict this to the bare minimum and leave out details such as X,Y,width and height position because it's easier to drag and drop your element instead of filling in these elements. Advanced modeThe advanced is how the dashboard used to displayed, so with all functionalities and details visible. This mode allows you to go into depth and really configure the event completely to your needs. For example:Profile configuration in advanced modeHere you cannot only configure your profile fields, but also the attendee info card, personal marker andeven add some css if necessary. Properties of a button in advanced modeHere we show all functionalities related to the configuration of a button, allowing you to also position this element by filling in X,Y, width and height. Or add URL/query parameters.
